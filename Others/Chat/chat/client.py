"""
WEEKEND MINI PROJECT Q2 :

You have been pretty disappointed at the current quality of chat room applications and vow to create your own, start up a new Internet company, obtain venture capital funding, integrate advertisement into your chat program, quintuple revenues in a six-month period, go public, and retire. However, none of this will happen if you do not have a pretty cool chat application. There are three classes you will need: a Message class containing a message string and any additional information such as broadcast or single recipient, and a User class that contains all the information for a person entering your chat rooms. To really wow the VCs to get your start-up capital, you add a class Room that represents a more sophisticated chat system where users can create separate "rooms" within the chat area and invite others to join. Extra credit: Develop graphical user interface (GUI) applications for the users.

# full form- socket.socket(family=AF_INET, type=SOCK_STREAM, proto=0, fileno=None)
# Create a new socket using the given address family, socket type and protocol number. The address family should be AF_INET (the default), AF_INET6, AF_UNIX, AF_CAN or AF_RDS.
# The socket type should be SOCK_STREAM (the default), SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW or perhaps one of the other SOCK_ constants. The protocol number is usually zero.

# See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero.
# 1024 is the buffer size or number of bytes you can recieve at a time. For fastest recv or send its best to keep the buffer size at 20 also reduces load on servers on processing too much data
